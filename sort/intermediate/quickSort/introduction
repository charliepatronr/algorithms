// liKE MERGE SORT, Quick sort exploits the fact that arrays of 
// 0 ir 1 element are always sorted 

// Works by selecting one elment called the pivot 
// and finding the index where the pivot should end up
// in the sorted array

// Moves all the numbers in which are smaller than the pivots 
// to the left of the array 
// and the greater ones to the right 
// ASSURING that the pivot is in the correct index 
// it repeats the process untill the array is sorted 
// the order on either side of the pivot doesnt matter
// this helper function should do everything in place and not 
// create a new array

// it should return the index of the pivot 


// the run time of quick sort depends in part on how one selects the pivot

// ideally the pivot should be chosen so that it is roughly the median value in the data set 
// we will pock the first element to make it simple
