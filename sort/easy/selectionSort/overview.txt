Selection Sort 



Similar to buuble sort, but instead of first placing large values into sorted position, it places
small values into sorted position


Starts with first value, itereates through array, compares with each value trying to find a min, and inserts
the min as the first value. Repeats process at arr[1] and continues to arr[n-1]

TIME COMPLEXITY 

O(n^2)
Only better than bubble sort, if you want to minimize the number of swaps you want to make
better in writing to memory
