//Bubble Sort

a sorting algorithm where the largest values bubble up to the top
the largest value in each iteration bubbles to the last place in the array 
you dont have to loop the length of the array after bubbliing since unsorted values decrease by 
array.length -1 

O(n^2) normally for bubble sort 

best case if array is almost completetly sorted with optimized version => O(n)

ONLY USE IF YOU KNOW ARRAY IS ALMOST SORTED
