 

 Big O Binary Search 

 Binary search only works on sorted arrays 
 if not sorted you must use linear search


Worst and average case 
O(log n) 

Ex: 16 elements in array = 4 steps if value is not in array
16 log 2 = 4
32 elements = 5 steps (worst case again)
32 log 2 = 5

Best case 
O(1)
Because it is possible that the first pick (middle) is the value we are searching for, very rare case.
